  "para1": "Bottles are the standard method of preserving liquids in compromising situations. They are not craftable by hand, but instead will appear when a MegaCorp machine containing liquid is broken.",
  "para2": "To re-use the liquid inside the bottle, simply treat it as a bucket or similar device. For example, you may right click on a tank or machine to insert it, if applicable. Once the bottle is empty, it will automagically throw itself out for your convenience."
