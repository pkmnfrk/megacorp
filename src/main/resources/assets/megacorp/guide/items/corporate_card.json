    "The Corporate Card is an item with a single use: To link unlinked machines to your Corporation. To do this, simply follow these steps:",
    "1. If your card is unlinked (freshly crafted), go to a MegaCorp Uplink that is already linked to the desired MegaCorp, and insert the card into the slot on its Gui. This will link the card.",
    "2. With the Corporate Card in your hand, go to the unlinked machine and right click on it.",
    "Note: A machine may only ever be linked to a single corporation. If linked to the wrong corporation, you will need to break and re-place it in order to try again.",
    "Note: Not all machines need linking. If a machine needs linking, its Gui will only show a message stating as much."
